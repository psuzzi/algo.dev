== explain tcp/ip

TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol) specifies how the data is exchanged over internet by providing end-to-end communications  


Online data needs to know where is going

Layers: 
- Application: different protocols use different ports. example: http uses port 80 
- Transport: TCP split the data in packets, that individually get the quickest route toward the destination. Each packet has an header to tell in which order the packets have to be reassembled.
- Internet: uses IP to attach origin and destination addresses, so the packet knows where comes from and where it has to go.
- Network: handle mac addressing, and bits
