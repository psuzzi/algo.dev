= Valid anagram

Given a string containing just parentheses '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

Valid means: 
- open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets
- open brackets must be closed in the correct order

== Using a stack 

A natural solution is using a stack to keep the parentheses encountered so far. 
For each new open parenthesis, we add it to the stack. 

For each closing parentheses, if matches the last on top of the stack or is invalid. When matches, we remove the corresponding opening one.

When we read all the parentheses, if the stack is empty, it's a valid solution


----
stack = []
for char c in s
    if c == '(' or c == '[' or c=='{'
        stack.push( c )
    else {
        if stack.size = 0
            return false
        op = stack.pop()
        if not ( op == '(' and c == ')' or 
                 op == '[' and c == ']' or 
                 op == '{' and c == '}' )
            return false
    }
return stack.size == 0
