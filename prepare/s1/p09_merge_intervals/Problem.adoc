== Solution

Idea: sort the intervals by their starting time. Then, loop through the intervals and compare finish time of one with starting time of the next. 
If the intervals are overlapping, merge them, otherwise add a new interval.

----
sort( intervals, by_start_time )

for i = 1 to interval.len-1
    if i==0 or cur_int[1] < intervals[i].len
        cur_int = intervals[i]
        res.add( cur_int )
    else
        cur_int[1] = max( cur_int[1], intervals[i][1] )
