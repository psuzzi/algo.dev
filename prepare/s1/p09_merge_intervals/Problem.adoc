= Three sum in O(n^2)

Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

Example 1:

Input: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].
Example 2:

Input: [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.

== Solution

Idea: sort the intervals by their starting time. Then, loop through the intervals and compare finish time of one with starting time of the next. 
If the intervals are overlapping, merge them, otherwise add a new interval.

----
sort( intervals, by_start_time )

for i = 1 to interval.len-1
    if i==0 or cur_int[1] < intervals[i].len
        cur_int = intervals[i]
        res.add( cur_int )
    else
        cur_int[1] = max( cur_int[1], intervals[i][1] )
