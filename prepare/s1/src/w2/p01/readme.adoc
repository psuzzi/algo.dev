= Reverse a LinkedList

Reverse a singly linked list.


Example: 
The input list `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> null`,
should change to `5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> null`

Description: https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/

== Solution (Iterative)

Go through all the list. 
For each node in the list, starting from the head

. store the reference to `node.next` in a temporary variable `tempNext`
. change the reference of `node.next` to the previous node of the list, or null if this is the first element processed  
. store the reference of `prev` node to the current node. At the next loop, this will be the previous node  
. set the reference of `curr` node to `tempNext`. At the next loop, this will be the current node

Algorithm:

----
reverse_list( node )
	prev = null
	curr = head
	while curr != null
		tempNext = curr.next
		curr.next = prev
		prev = curr
		curr = tempNext
	return prev
