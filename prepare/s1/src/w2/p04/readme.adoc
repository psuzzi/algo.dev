=  Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e.,  [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become  [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

Find the minimum element.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Example 1:

Input: [3,4,5,1,2] 
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Description: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/


== Solution

Observation: the list was previously ordered, 
hence the first number breaking the increasing sequence is the minimum. 


----
findMin( int[] nums )
	for int i=0 to nums.len-1
		if nums[i] > nums[i+1]
			return nums[i]
		return nums[0]
----

Time: O(n)
