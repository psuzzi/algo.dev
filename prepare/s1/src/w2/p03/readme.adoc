= Container With Most Water

Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

== Solution, Brute Force

A naive solution would be checking all the pairs. 

----
maxArea( int[] height )
	maxArea = 0
	for i = 0 to height.len -1
		for j = i tp height.lem
			minHeight = min( height[i], height[j] )
			maxArea = max( minHeight*(j-i), maxArea
	return maxArea
----

Time: O(n^2)


== Solution 2, Two pointers

Intuition: 
* the area is limited by the height of the shortest line
* the farther are the lines, the bigger will be the area

----
maxArea( int[] height )
	maxArea = 0
	l=0, r=height.len-1
	while r < l
		minHeight = min( height[r], height[l] )
		maxArea = max( minHeight*(r-l), maxArea
		if(height[r] < height[l])
			r--
		else
			l++
----

Time: O(n)
