= Valid anagram

Given two strings s and t determine if t is a valid anagram of s

== Counting letters

We can count the occurrences of each character of s, and then verify the same letters are used in t

----
count = new int[26]
for i=0 to len(s)
    index = index(s[i])
    count[i] ++
for i=0 to len(t)
    index = index(t[i])
    count[i] --
for i=0 to len()
----

time/space complexity: O(n)/O(1)
