## Solution

This exercise is about pattern matching.

### Simple Solution: Two pointers

Scan all the chars in the input string with an index "i". When finding a character matching the first char of the pattern, use a second pointer "j" to check for a full match. In case there is no full match, backtrack the "i" index 

----
j=0
for i=0 to s.len
	if s[i] == p[j]
		if j == p.len-1
			return i-j #start index
		else
			j++
	else
		i-=j # backtrack
		j=0;
return -1
