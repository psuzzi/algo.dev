a mural consisting of a row of moons"C" and umbrellas "J"
copyright on CJ and JC.
- each time CJ appears in the mural, Cody-Jamal must pay X
- each time JC appears in the mural, he must pay Y.


empty spaces he still has could be filled strategically, to MINIMIZE the copyright expenses.

For example, given CJ?CC? current state of the mural, he could finish the mural as with the costs on 2nd column
- CJCCCC	X+Y one CJ + one JC
- CJCCCJ	2X+Y two CJ one JC
- CJJCCC	X+Y
- CJJCCJ	2X+Y



Given the costs X and Y and a string representing the current state of the mural
