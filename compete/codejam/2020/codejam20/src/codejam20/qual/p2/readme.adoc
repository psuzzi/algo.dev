= CJ2020 Qual P2 - Nesting Depth

You get a string `s` with digits.
Modify the string by inserting the minimum number of open and closing parentheses so that the string is balanced and each digit `d` is nested inside exactly `d` pairs of parentheses.

For instance: 

----
101     --> (1)0(1)
111000` --> (111)000
----

== Solution - Balance parentheses counting depth

We can solve by using an integer to keep track of the current `level` (nesting depth). 
Then, comparing each digit with the level, we know how many parentheses to open/close

----
result = ''
level = 0

for char c in input_string
	n = c-'0'
	while level<n 
		result.add( '(' )
		level++
	while level>n
		result.add( ')' )
		level--
	result.add( n )
while level>0
	result.add( ')' )
	level--

return result
