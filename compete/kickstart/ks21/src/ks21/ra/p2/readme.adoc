= L Shaped Plots, KS 21 A 1

https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart/round/0000000000436140/000000000068c509

== Problem

Scan a 2D "1 or 0" array to find all possible L-shaped plots.
For each L the ratio between the longer and the shorter segment is 2:1
Count the number of L.

== Idea

* scan each element of the array
* determine if an element is an endpoint, where the two segments intersect
* for each endpoint there are four cases of how the L is orientated
* for all these four cases, count the number of Ls based on the length of the legs
