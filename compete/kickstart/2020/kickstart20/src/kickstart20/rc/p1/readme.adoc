= Kickstart RB P1 - Countdown

There is an array of N integers, i.e. `1 2 3 7 9 3 2 1 8 3 2 1`. Tell how many k-conuntdown are in there. 
For instance, with the array below, and k=3, we see two 3-countdowm, in the form `3 2 1 `.

== Solution 

Initialize a counter to `0`. 
Loop the array for an element = `k`. 
Check if the value is decreasing forming a sequence `k`, `k-1`, .. `1`. 
In this case, increase the k-countdown value.

----
solve( numbers[], k)
    glob_count = 0
     = 0
    for i=0 to numbers.len
        if cdlen>0 && numbers[i] = numbers[i-1] + 1
            cdlen = cdlen-1
            if cdlen == 0
                kcount++
        if numbers[i] = k
            // start countdown
            cdlen=k

    return kcount
