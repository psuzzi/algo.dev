= Kickstart RB P1 - Countdown

Description: https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart/round/000000000019ff43/00000000003380d2


== Solution 

Idea: loop backward through the array. 
The idea is to simulate the celebrity path, and then, for each step Si determine the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry[Manhattan distance] starting from your position. If you can reach such point by the time the celebrity arrives there, you meet the celebrity.

In this case, max(your-time-to-Si, celeb-time-to-Si) is one of the ways to reach the celebrity. To solve the problem, you need to select the minimum of the above.
